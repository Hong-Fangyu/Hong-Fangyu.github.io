Hi! My name is Fangyu Hong (Ê¥™Ëä≥ÂÆá), I have been a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Professor Guohua Wu Since 2023. Now I am a Joint-PhD student in the Joint PhD Program offered by City University of Hong Kong(CityU) and Central South University (CSU). And I will go to CityU to continue my research under the advisory of Dr. Xiangyu Zhao in 2025 fall.

My research interests mainly focus on intelligent optimization methods for drone systems and low-altitude airspace management.
